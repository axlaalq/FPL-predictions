# FPL-predictions
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for analyzing and predicting the results of football matches in Fantasy Premier League (FPL) and comparing these predictions with those made by various betting houses. The aim is to use data science and machine learning techniques to:

Analyze historical match data.

Predict match outcomes (e.g., win, draw, loss) and scores.

Compare machine learning model predictions with betting odds.

Identify patterns or inconsistencies in betting house predictions.

The project is designed for enthusiasts of football analytics, data science, and machine learning who want to explore predictive modeling in sports or understand how betting odds align with analytical models.


Betting Odds Comparison

Scrape or impData Preprocessing

Clean and prepare historical FPL and betting data.

Feature engineering for better model input.

Machine Learning Models

Implement models like logistic regression, random forests, and neural networks for match outcome prediction.

Optimize models using techniques like cross-validation and hyperparort odds from major betting houses.

Calculate implied probabilities and compare them with model predictions.

Evaluation Metrics

Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and log loss for model evaluation.

Compare betting house accuracy against machine learning models.

Visualization

Create insightful plots and visualizations to showcase findings.
